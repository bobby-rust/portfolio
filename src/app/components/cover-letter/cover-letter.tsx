                Completing the Computer Science program has been a
                transformative experience that not only deepened my technical
                expertise but also shaped my professional goals and values. This
                journey has enabled me to showcase my strengths through
                practical projects, reinforce foundational principles, and
                prepare for a career in a constantly evolving and competitive
                field.

            <p className="leading-loose tracking-wide">
                Throughout the program, I’ve strengthened my ability to
                collaborate in team environments both in academic settings and
                real-world projects. Group assignments and peer code reviews
                taught me the importance of version control, code consistency,
                and conflict resolution. I gained experience using tools like
                Git and platforms like GitHub to manage collaborative
                development efforts effectively.

            <p className="leading-loose tracking-wide">
                Equally important was communicating with stakeholders. Whether
                presenting a proposal or writing technical documentation, I
                learned to convey complex ideas in a clear, approachable manner.
                This skill has been crucial when sharing technical progress with
                non-technical peers, and it will continue to serve me as I work
                with clients, end-users, and cross-functional teams in the
                industry.

            <p className="leading-loose tracking-wide">
                My coursework solidified a strong foundation in core computer
                science principles including data structures and algorithms.
                Assignments involving binary trees, graphs, and sorting
                algorithms helped me develop solutions that are not only correct
                but optimized for performance. These principles were crucial
                when building projects like my university course scheduler that
                utilizes topological sorting in a directed acyclic graph to
                resolve course dependencies.

                The program also provided a comprehensive understanding of
                software engineering and database management. I designed and
                built full-stack applications using modern tools and frameworks,
                applying principles of modular design, clean architecture, and
                scalability. I’ve implemented RESTful APIs, built normalized
                relational schemas, and worked with NoSQL databases like
                MongoDB. These experiences reflect my ability to manage data
                flow across client-server architectures and persist data
                securely and efficiently.

            <br />
            <p className="leading-loose tracking-wide">
                Security was a constant consideration in my projects. I
                implemented user authentication using JWTs, practiced secure
                handling of form inputs, and learned to mitigate vulnerabilities
                such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. These skills are
                now ingrained in how I approach application design and
                development in every stage of the software development
                lifecycle.

                The artifacts in this portfolio showcase a range of competencies
                that reflect both breadth and depth in computer science. Each
                was chosen to demonstrate a different dimension of my skill set,
                from algorithmic thinking to full-stack development and API
                integration. Collectively, they tell the story of a developer
                who understands not just how to build software, but how to build
                it thoughtfully, securely, and for real-world use cases.
